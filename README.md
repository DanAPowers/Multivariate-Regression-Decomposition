### Multivariate-Regression-Decomposition
This module decomposes an observed group difference in means/proportions/counts/rates estimated from multivariate regression models into components reflecting group differences in characteristics and group differences in the effects of those characteristics. The methodology is described in D.Powers, H.Yoshioka and M-S. Yun -- mvdcmp: Multivariate Decomposition for Nonlinear Response Models, Stata Journal (2011). 11, Number 4, pp. 556â€“576.

Multivariate decomposition is widely used in research to quantify the contributions to group differences in average predictions from multivariate models. The technique utilizes the output from regression models to parcel out components of a group difference in a statistic, such as a mean or proportion, which can be attributed to compositional differences between groups (i.e., differences in characteristics or endowments) and to differences in the effects of characteristics (i.e., differences in the returns, coefficients, or behavioral responses). These techniques are equally applicable for partitioning change over time into components attributable to changing effects and changing composition.
